This project was from grade 10 that is a prototype for a real AI waste analyzer. Instead of using real objects for it, it makes use of cards first to test the efficiency of an AI machine learning model Keras.
It makes use of the coding language python and the openCV library. The training of the model was set in Teachable Machine, A website where you can train your models on image, sound and pose recognition and uploaded in the
python project.
